                <strong>What is Formula One?</strong><br>
                <br> 
                Formula One, often referred as F1, is a premier motorsport characterized by high-speed, open-wheel racing cars competing in a series of international races known as Grands Prix. 
                Each vehicle is designed by their individual teams, which showcase advanced engineering/aerodynamics, powerful engines, and ultramodern technology. 
                Drivers, known for their exceptional skills and physical endurance, compete on a diverse range of tracks, circuits, and city streets aiming to accumulate points over the season.
                The <a href = "https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2023/team.html" >F1 World Championship</a> crowns the top driver and team, fostering intense rivalries, innovation, and global viewership due to its thrilling combination of speed, strategy, and precision driving.
                Not only is this sport hyper competitive but there are only 20 seats which means drivers have to consistently prove they belong on that seat otherwise there out.

                    One of my favorite drivers, <a href ="https://www.formula1.com/en/drivers/hall-of-fame/Lewis_Hamilton.html"> Lewis Hamilton </a>, has an impressive record as a seven-time world champion. However, what truly captivated me was his story.
                    Coming from a humble upbringing without luxury, success wasn't simply served to him on a silver platter. With unwavering dedication, his parents poured every ounce of their resources into fueling his career in formula racing. Remarkably, he emerged as one of the preeminent Formula 1 drivers.
                    His upbringing in this sport, particularly in its limited diversity landscape, was fraught with challenges. Yet, he confronted these adversities head-on. Regardless of external judgment, he retained his composure, allowing his actions on the track to define him. 
                    His story serves as a wellspring of inspiration to me. Witnessing his triumph over obstacles and his ascent to success fuels my own aspirations, motivating me to work hard towards my goals.
